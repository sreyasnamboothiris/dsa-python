# Queue

A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. Elements are added to the rear and removed from the front.

## Characteristics of Queue:
- **FIFO Principle:** The first element added is the first one to be removed.
- **Dynamic Size:** Queues can grow or shrink as needed.
- **Two Access Points:** Operations are performed at both the front and rear.

## Operations on Queue:
- **Enqueue:** Adding an element to the rear of the queue.
- **Dequeue:** Removing the front element from the queue.
- **Front/Peek:** Accessing the front element without removing it.
- **IsEmpty:** Checking if the queue is empty.

## Applications of Queue:
- Task scheduling (e.g., job scheduling in operating systems).
- Buffer management (e.g., IO buffers).
- Breadth-First Search (BFS) in graphs.
- Print job management.

## Operations on Queue:
- **Enqueue:** Adding an element to the rear of the queue.
  - Time Complexity: O(1)
- **Dequeue:** Removing the front element from the queue.
  - Time Complexity: O(1)
- **Front/Peek:** Accessing the front element without removing it.
  - Time Complexity: O(1)
- **IsEmpty:** Checking if the queue is empty.
